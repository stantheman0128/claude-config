## Source: What to Build for Solana DeFi (2024)

https://blog.superteam.fun/p/what-to-build-for-solana-defi

Written when Solana DeFi TVL was ~$4B and daily DEX volumes hit $4B+. The post identifies 10 themes across DeFi primitives that were missing or underdeveloped on Solana.

### Solana FX Market

**Problem:** $6 trillion daily volume in traditional FX. Fiat-backed stablecoins (USDC, EURC, etc.) now have real liquidity but no native spot FX venue on-chain.

**Opportunity:** Build on-chain spot foreign exchange through order books and AMMs. Enable instant currency conversion for merchants accepting stablecoin payments. Cross-border commerce without bank FX spreads.

**Competitors:** No direct on-chain competitor on Solana. Traditional FX is dominated by bank OTC desks.

### Morpho Optimizer for Solana

**Problem:** Pool-based lending (Kamino, Save/Solend) has utilization gaps — deposited capital earns suboptimal rates because not all of it is borrowed.

**Opportunity:** Peer-to-peer matching layer on top of existing money markets. When matched, lenders receive the full borrower rate at 100% utilization. Unmatched capital falls back to the underlying pool. Morpho on Ethereum has $12B+ AUM proving the model.

**Competitors:** Flexlend, JuicerFi (early), Lulo Finance (routing). None have built the full optimizer model on Solana.

### Fixed-Rate Lending Protocol

**Problem:** TradFi is 98% fixed rate. DeFi is almost entirely floating rate. Institutions and businesses need predictable borrowing costs.

**Competitors (Ethereum):** Yield Protocol, Notional Finance, Exactly Finance, Term Finance. On Solana: Lulo Finance does rate routing but not fixed-rate origination.

**Why it's hard:** Maintaining fixed-rate positions requires active management. Historical DeFi attempts underperformed. But institutional demand is real.

### Composable Leverage Protocol (Gearbox for Solana)

**Problem:** Leveraged yield farming requires manual looping across multiple protocols.

**Opportunity:** One-click composable leverage. Deposit collateral, protocol borrows and deploys across AMMs, LSTs, and incentive programs automatically. Gearbox on Ethereum proved the model.

**Integrations:** Kamino, Jupiter, Drift, Meteora, Sanctum — the leverage protocol connects all of these.

### Corporate On-chain Bonds

**Problem:** On-chain companies (protocols, DAOs) with real revenue have no way to raise debt capital without dilutive token emissions.

**Opportunity:** Transparent blockchain-based bonds backed by on-chain revenue streams. Investors can verify revenue in real-time. No token dilution for issuers.

### Interest Rate Swaps for LSTs

**Problem:** LST staking yields fluctuate. Institutions want predictable returns.

**Opportunity:** Forward contracts exchanging fixed staking rates for floating on JitoSOL, mSOL, etc. LST staking rate becomes the Solana "risk-free rate." Enables a full yield curve.

### Tokenized Vault Standard for Solana (ERC-4626 Equivalent)

**Problem:** No standard interface for yield-bearing vaults on Solana. Every protocol has its own vault implementation, breaking composability.

**Opportunity:** Universal vault standard enabling any yield source to be wrapped and composed. On Ethereum, ERC-4626 has $10B+ TVL and powers the entire vault ecosystem.

### Vertical Perps / Niche Markets

**Problem:** Perps exist for major crypto assets but not for commodities, real estate, events, or sector indices.

**Reference:** Parcl (real estate perps) proved the concept with $100M+ TVL at peak. Space is wide open for other verticals.

### Power Perps

**Problem:** Standard perps offer linear leverage. Some traders want convex/non-linear payoff structures.

**Origin:** Paradigm research paper. Exponents (Berachain) exploring. Nobody on Solana.

### Everlasting Options

**Problem:** Options expire, requiring active management and rollover.

**Opportunity:** Perpetual options that never expire. Combines the perpetual funding mechanism with options payoffs. Originally proposed by SBF in Paradigm research.

### Perp Aggregator

**Opportunity:** Route perp trades across Drift, Jupiter Perps, Flash Trade for best execution. Similar to how Jupiter aggregates spot DEXs. Reference: Rage Trade, MUX Protocol on Ethereum.

### Market-Making Vaults for Order Books

**Problem:** Order book DEXs (Phoenix) need market makers. Passive LPs can't easily provide orderbook liquidity.

**Opportunity:** Decentralized MM vaults that programmatically place and manage orders. Ensures depth isn't dependent on a single market maker.

### Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) Protocol

**Problem:** Arbitrageurs and liquidators capture value from oracle price update timing. Applications lose this value.

**Opportunity:** Application-owned orderflow auctions that capture OEV before external searchers. Reference: Multicoin Capital research on this topic.

### Risk Management DAO

**Opportunity:** Publish risk dashboards, frameworks, and ratings for Solana DeFi protocols. Offer paid risk assessments to institutional allocators. The Moody's/S&P for DeFi.

### Bribe Aggregator / Marketplace

**Opportunity:** Aggregate bribes from projects for LST staking governance, Jupiter LFG voting, and other protocol participation. Votium model for Solana.

### Instadapp for Solana

**Opportunity:** All-in-one DeFi management — leverage, refinance, migrate positions across protocols in one click. No equivalent on Solana today.

### DeFi Structured Products Vaults

**Opportunity:** Automated DOV strategies — covered calls, put spreads, delta-neutral yield. Friktion reached $500M+ TVL before shutting down. Code is available. Space is open again.

### Solana Perp DEX Appchain

**Opportunity:** Dedicated appchain for perp trading — no mainnet congestion, gas-free trading. Precedent: Zeta/Bullet, dYdX, Hyperliquid all went appchain.

### Continuous Prediction Markets via Memecoins

**Opportunity:** Political/event memecoins as continuous prediction markets. Unlike binary prediction markets, no cap on returns. MetaDAO (governance) is an early example.

### Yield Aggregator

**Opportunity:** Route to optimal yield across Solana lending, staking, and farming. Single interface for discovery.

## Source: Layer 1 Wars: It's About AI Agents (2025)

https://blog.superteam.fun/p/layer-1-wars-its-about-ai-agents

Argues that agentic payments don't fit on today's payment infrastructure, creating opportunity for middleware and protocol improvements.

### Agent-Native Payment Middleware

**Three modules:** (1) Stripe-like interface handling agent inputs/outputs to blockchain, (2) policy engine defining automation and spending rules, (3) fraud detection with explainability. Sits between AI labs' APIs and public blockchains.

**Why crypto:** Agents can't use credit cards (KYC, chargebacks, minimum amounts). Stablecoins are cash-like — transfer and it's done. No recourse, no settlement uncertainty.

### Agentic Payment Protocol

Settlement protocol for high-volume machine-to-machine micropayments. Deterministic finality, native programmability, automated dispute resolution. 1-2 cent transactions that card rails can't serve.

### Agent-Aware Compliance Layer

Token-level transfer hooks enforcing KYC/AML at the protocol level. Uses Solana Token Extensions. Prevents rogue probabilistic agents from violating compliance regardless of LLM outputs.

### Machine-to-Machine Dispute Resolution

Smart-contract based with optional LLM-to-LLM communication for dispute context. For micropayments where manual dispute resolution costs exceed the transaction amount.

https://blog.superteam.fun/p/stop-building-for-crypto-twitter

Argues that crypto builders should target real-world markets, not crypto-native users.

### Open Ride-Sharing Network

Decentralized ride-sharing where profiles are composable, ratings are public, and payments work across multiple interfaces. No single entity controls the network. Reference: Teleport.

### Open Accommodations Marketplace

Airbnb/Booking.com competitor with real-time inventory, property information, and pricing accessible to any app builder through open APIs.

## Source: State of Solana DePIN 2024

https://blog.superteam.fun/p/state-of-solana-depin-2024

Comprehensive overview of the DePIN landscape on Solana with forward-looking opportunities.

### DePIN-specific SVM Rollup

SVM-based rollup optimized for DePIN. Greater control over block production, gas, and state while leveraging existing Solana tooling and ecosystem.

### ZK-verifiable GPU Cloud

On-chain GPU computing with zero-knowledge proofs verifying computation. Enables decentralized AI inferencing at scale. Currently expensive but costs are falling rapidly.

### Hardware Financing via RWA

Tokenized funding for physical DePIN infrastructure. Investors buy fractional ownership of hardware (miners, sensors, chargers). Hardware generates revenue that flows to token holders.

Makes the case for tokenizing regional government securities and bonds for global DeFi access.

### Tokenized Regional Government Securities

Blockchain-based government securities with 24/7 access and T+0 settlement. Offers global investors exposure to higher-yield regional bonds (7-8.5% in INR for Indian G-Secs vs 4-5% US Treasuries).

### Tokenized Regional Green Bonds

Sovereign green bonds on public blockchains. Solves liquidity issues and greenwashing transparency for climate-focused investors.

### Cross-Chain DeFi Capital Connector

Neutral protocol standardizing KYC, AML, and capital control enforcement across multiple blockchains. Enables regional regulated assets to be accessible on global DeFi venues.
