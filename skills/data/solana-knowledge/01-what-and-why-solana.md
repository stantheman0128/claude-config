## What Is Solana

Solana is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for mass adoption. It processes transactions in ~400ms block times at a fraction of a cent per transaction, making it practical for applications that need real-time speed and low cost -- payments, trading, gaming, social, and more.

Unlike blockchains that rely on Layer 2 rollups or sharding to scale, Solana runs on a single global state machine. Every validator sees the same state, every program can compose with every other program, and every transaction settles on the base layer. This architectural choice means developers get composability by default -- no bridging, no cross-shard communication, no fragmented liquidity.

Solana launched on mainnet-beta in March 2020. The native token is **SOL**, used for transaction fees, staking, and governance.

## Why Build on Solana

### Performance Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Block time | ~400ms |
| Transaction cost | ~$0.00025 |
| Theoretical TPS | 65,000+ |
| Observed peak TPS | 10,000+ sustained (excluding vote txs) |
| Finality | ~400ms (optimistic), ~12s (rooted) |
| Validator count | 1,500+ |

These are not testnet numbers. This is mainnet, processing billions of dollars in volume daily.

### Cost Comparison

| Chain | Avg Transaction Cost |
|-------|---------------------|
| Solana | ~$0.00025 |
| Ethereum L1 | $1-50+ (varies with congestion) |
| Arbitrum / Optimism | $0.01-0.50 |
| Polygon PoS | $0.01-0.05 |
| Avalanche C-Chain | $0.01-0.10 |

Solana's fee model makes it viable to build applications that require thousands or millions of transactions -- high-frequency trading, micropayments, on-chain gaming, real-time social feeds.

## Why Solana Over Other L1s

### Single Global State
Unlike sharded chains (Ethereum 2.0 danksharding, NEAR, Elrond), Solana maintains a single global state. This means:
- Any program can call any other program in the same transaction
- No cross-shard communication delays
- No liquidity fragmentation
- Atomic composability by default

### No Layer 2 Required
Ethereum's scaling strategy relies on L2 rollups (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc.). This introduces:
- Bridging risk and UX friction
- Liquidity fragmentation across L2s
- Higher costs for L1 settlement
- Complex developer experience (which L2? which bridge?)

Solana scales at L1. One chain, one state, one developer experience.

### Composability
Because everything runs on one state machine, Solana programs can compose freely:
- A single transaction can swap tokens on Jupiter, deposit into Kamino, and stake LP tokens -- atomically
- Flash loans, arbitrage, and complex DeFi strategies are first-class citizens
- No bridge risk, no cross-chain MEV extraction

### Low Latency
~400ms block times mean applications feel instant:
- Trading interfaces update in real time
- Games can run on-chain logic without perceptible delay
- Payment confirmations are near-instant

### Comparison Table

| Feature | Solana | Ethereum | Avalanche | Sui |
|---------|--------|----------|-----------|-----|
| Block time | ~400ms | ~12s | ~2s | ~400ms |
| Tx cost | ~$0.00025 | $1-50+ | $0.01-0.10 | ~$0.001 |
| State model | Single global | Sharded (planned) | Subnets | Object-based |
| Smart contract lang | Rust | Solidity | Solidity | Move |
| Composability | Full (single state) | Within L2 silo | Within subnet | Full |
| DeFi TVL | Top 3 | #1 | Top 10 | Growing |
| Validator count | 1,500+ | 900k+ | 1,200+ | ~100 |
