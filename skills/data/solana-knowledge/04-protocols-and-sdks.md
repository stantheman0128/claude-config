# Solana Protocols and SDKs

> Comprehensive reference for every major protocol, SDK, and service a Solana developer would integrate. Organized by category with key URLs, npm packages, and guidance on when to use each.

---

## Integrate First, Build Second

**Default recommendation: integrate an existing protocol before building a custom smart contract.** Default to custom development when the user is clearly building the protocol layer itself or needs novel on-chain logic.

Most apps don't need a new on-chain program. Existing protocols have battle-tested contracts handling billions in TVL, TypeScript SDKs for direct frontend integration, established liquidity, and ongoing security maintenance.

**When to integrate (most cases):**
- Trading UIs, portfolio dashboards, DeFi aggregators
- Adding swap, lending, or perps functionality to an app
- Bots, agents, or automation on top of DeFi
- Stablecoin payments, fintech apps, or payment rails (integrate existing stablecoin infra + Jupiter for conversions)
- Any frontend-only or API-only project

**When to build custom:**
- User wants to own the protocol layer or build novel on-chain logic/state
- Novel mechanism design that doesn't exist yet (new AMM curve, new collateral model)
- Need on-chain composability that existing protocols don't expose
- User explicitly says "build a program", "smart contract", or "on-chain protocol"

When in doubt, integrate. You ship faster, inherit security and liquidity, and can always build custom later if the integrated approach hits a wall.

## Protocol Health Verification

**Before recommending any protocol, verify it is alive, liquid, and safe.** Never rely solely on the static recommendations in this document — protocols can decline, get exploited, or shut down.

### How to Check Protocol Health

Use whatever data source is available — DefiLlama MCP tools if installed, DefiLlama API directly, or web search. The key data points to gather:

1. **TVL and trend** — Is the protocol still holding meaningful TVL? Is it growing or declining?
   - DefiLlama API: `GET https://api.llama.fi/protocol/{protocol-slug}`
   - DefiLlama API: `GET https://api.llama.fi/protocols` (list all, filter by chain/category)
   - Or use `mcp__defillama__get_protocol` / `mcp__defillama__search_protocols` if available

2. **Volume** — Is there active trading? Dead volume = dead protocol.
   - DefiLlama API: `GET https://api.llama.fi/overview/dexs/solana` (DEX volumes)
   - Or use `mcp__defillama__get_dex_overview` / `mcp__defillama__get_fees_overview` if available

3. **Hack history** — Has it been exploited? Did it recover?
   - DefiLlama API: `GET https://api.llama.fi/hacks`
   - Or use `mcp__defillama__get_hacks` if available

4. **SDK freshness** — Is the TypeScript SDK still maintained?
   ```bash
   npm view <package-name> time --json | jq 'to_entries | last'
   gh repo view <org>/<repo> --json updatedAt,stargazerCount
   ```

### Health Criteria

| Signal | Healthy | Warning | Avoid |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| TVL | >$50M | $5M–$50M | <$5M or declining >50% in 30d |
| 24h Volume | >$10M | $1M–$10M | <$1M |
| SDK last publish | <3 months | 3–6 months | >6 months |
| GitHub activity | Weekly commits | Monthly | No commits in 6+ months |
| Security | Audited, no major exploits | Audited, recovered from incident | Unaudited or unrecovered exploit |
| Documentation | Complete with examples | Exists but sparse | Missing or outdated |

### Defunct or Risky Protocol Signals

Do not auto-recommend any protocol that shows these patterns:
- **TVL near zero or crashed >90%** from peak without recovery
- **SDK abandoned** — no npm publish or GitHub commit in 6+ months, team unresponsive
- **Major unrecovered exploit** — funds lost, users not made whole
- **Officially sunset** — team announced shutdown or migration

If a protocol was exploited but recovered (repaid users, patched, resumed operations), note the history but don't auto-exclude — use judgment based on current health signals.

**Always verify current state before recommending.** This document is a starting point, not the final answer.
